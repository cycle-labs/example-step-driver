Title: Creating an OpenAPI Specification for Your Step Driver

---

Welcome back to our tutorial series on Step Drivers! In this installment, we'll explore the crucial step of designing an OpenAPI specification to define the behavior of your Step Driver. This specification serves as the blueprint for integrating custom test steps into Cycle, enabling seamless interaction with external systems under test (SUT).

### Understanding OpenAPI Specification

The [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/solutions/getting-started-with-oas/), formerly known as Swagger Specification, is a widely adopted standard for describing RESTful APIs. It provides a structured format for defining endpoints, request and response formats, authentication methods, and more. By leveraging the power of OpenAPI, you can ensure consistency, interoperability, and ease of integration across different systems and platforms.

### Leveraging ChatGPT for OpenAPI Specification Generation

To streamline the process of crafting your OpenAPI specification, we recommend harnessing the capabilities of ChatGPT. With its natural language processing prowess, ChatGPT can assist you in transforming your requirements and system functionalities into a comprehensive API specification.

### Example Scenario: Database Stored Procedure and Function

Let's illustrate this process with an example scenario featuring a database with a stored procedure and function:

```
create procedure transfer(
   sender int,
   receiver int, 
   amount dec
)
language plpgsql
AS ......

create function get_balance(account_id int)
returns text
language plpgsql
AS ......
```

### Converting Signatures to OpenAPI Specification

Using ChatGPT, we can generate an OpenAPI specification based on the provided signatures:

#### Example Prompt:
```
If I had a DB schema and wanted to expose a stored procedure and stored functions over an OpenAPI specification, generate the OpenAPI specification for me in YAML.  The OpenAPI specification must be such that the request types and response types are defined in $ref to components schema. The return type for each endpoint must be
    StepResponse:
      required:
        - status
      type: object
      properties:
        status:
          type: string
          enum:
            - pass
            - fail
        variables:
          type: object
          additionalProperties:
            oneOf:
              - type: string
              - type: integer
              - type: number
              - type: boolean
          nullable: true
        message:
          type: string
          nullable: true
        errorMessage:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          
The stored procedure and function signatures in the DB schema are:

create procedure transfer(
   sender int,
   receiver int, 
   amount dec
)
language plpgsql ;  

create function get_balance(account_id int)
returns text
language plpgsql ;
```

#### Example Output:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: DB Stored Procedures and Functions API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /transfer:
    post:
      summary: Transfer amount from one account to another
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/TransferRequest'
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful transfer
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/StepResponse'
  /balance/{account_id}:
    get:
      summary: Get balance of an account
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: account_id
          required: true
          schema:
            type: integer
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful balance retrieval
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/StepResponse'
components:
  schemas:
    TransferRequest:
      type: object
      required:
        - sender
        - receiver
        - amount
      properties:
        sender:
          type: integer
        receiver:
          type: integer
        amount:
          type: number
    StepResponse:
      required:
        - status
      type: object
      properties:
        status:
          type: string
          enum:
            - pass
            - fail
        variables:
          type: object
          additionalProperties:
            oneOf:
              - type: string
              - type: integer
              - type: number
              - type: boolean
          nullable: true
        message:
          type: string
          nullable: true
        errorMessage:
          type: string
          nullable: true
```

### Conclusion

With ChatGPT's assistance, you can swiftly generate an OpenAPI specification tailored to your Step Driver's requirements. This specification serves as the foundation for seamless integration with Cycle, enabling efficient testing of a wide range of systems under test. There is also an online editor available at https://editor-next.swagger.io which can help you validate your syntax and naviate your specification, as well as several IDEs and VSCode extensions.
