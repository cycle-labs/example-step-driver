Title: Getting Started with Step Driver Development in Go

---

Welcome to the next lesson in our Step Driver tutorial series! In this lesson, we'll guide you through the initial steps of setting up your development environment and generating boilerplate code for your Step Driver using Go and Gin HTTP server.

### Setting Up Your Environment

To get started, clone the "starter" project from the provided repository. Ensure that you update the module name to match your repository by running the following command:

```bash
go mod edit -module <your_new_module_name_here>
```

### Generating Boilerplate Code

Included in the project is a Makefile with commands to streamline the code generation process. It relies on you having set your GOPATH environment variable, which is typically `$HOME/go`. To generate the boilerplate code for your handlers, execute the following command:

```bash
make gen_api_server_all
```

This command will generate the gin.generated.go and models.generated.go files in the api directory for your handlers based on the defined interface.

Stay tuned for the next tutorial, where we'll dive into the implementation details of handlers for your Step Driver.

Happy coding!
