Title: Implementing Handlers for Your Step Driver in Go

---

Welcome back to our Step Driver tutorial series! In this tutorial, we'll delve into the implementation details of handlers for your Step Driver using Go and Gin HTTP server.

### Understanding Handler Implementation

In the generated code, locate the `ServerInterface` interface defined in `api/gin.generate.go`. This interface outlines the methods that your handlers must implement. We will be providing the implementation for this interface in `driver/handlers.go`. By convention, these handlers parse incoming requests, delegate work to the appropriate methods in the `DriverService` defined in `driver/service.go`, and then formulate the appropriate HTTP response.

### Example: Implementing the Transfer Handler

Let's examine the example implementation of the `Transfer` handler in `handlers.go`, where we deserialize the request body, call the service's `Transfer` method, and formulate the appropriate `StepResponse`. In the initial `handlers.go` file, there is a placeholder implementation of:

```go
// Transfer funds between accounts
// (POST /transfer)
func (h *GinHandlers) PostTransfer(c *gin.Context) {
	// TODO: Provide Implementation
	panic("not implemented")
}
```

In [handlers.go](../sp-driver-stateless/driver/handlers.go), we provide an example implementation that binds the body to a api.Transfer variable called `t`. This type comes from the generated code in `api/models.generated.go`. We then call `h.service.Transfer`, passing in the values from `t` to perform the actual transfer. Finally, we format the appropriate api.StepResponse based on the outcome of the transfer operation.
```go
// Execute a transfer
// (POST /transfer)
func (h *GinHandlers) Transfer(c *gin.Context) {
	var t api.Transfer
	err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&t)
	if err != nil {
		c.AbortWithError(http.StatusBadRequest, err)
		return
	}
	amount, err := FromMonetaryValue(t.Amount)
	if err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, api.ErrorMessage{Message: err.Error()})
		return
	}
	err = h.service.Transfer(c, t.Sender, t.Receiver, *amount)
	if err != nil {
		errMessage := err.Error()
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, api.StepResponse{
			Status:       api.Fail,
			ErrorMessage: &errMessage,
		})
		return
	}
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, api.StepResponse{Status: api.Pass})
}
```

### Note on Method Names
It's important to note that the method names in your handler will be generated based on the operations defined in your API's OpenAPI specification. As a result, the method names under ServerInterface in this provided example will not be exactly the same as those produced by the code generatino tool based on the operations of your specific API.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored the process of implementing handlers for your Step Driver in Go. By adhering to conventions and leveraging the provided boilerplate code, you can efficiently interact with Cycle's execution engine.
