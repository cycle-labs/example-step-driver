Title: Extending Cycle: Introducing Step Drivers for Enhanced Test Automation

---

Welcome to Cycle Labs' tutorial on Step Drivers, your gateway to expanding the capabilities of Cycle, our comprehensive test automation platform. In this tutorial, we will delve into the exciting realm of Step Drivers, enabling you to seamlessly interface Cycle with a broader spectrum of systems under test (SUT).

### Understanding Step Drivers

As the landscape of enterprise supply chain applications continues to evolve, the need for robust testing solutions has never been more critical. Cycle, designed with a focus on empowering non-technical users, offers a versatile suite of testing functionalities, ranging from API tests to web and desktop application testing.

However, recognizing the diverse array of systems our customers need to test, we acknowledge the inherent limitations in providing out-of-the-box support for every possible protocol. Enter Step Drivers â€“ a game-changing feature that bridges this gap by offering a pathway to extend Cycle's capabilities dynamically.

### What Are Step Drivers?

Step Drivers are lightweight processes designed to augment Cycle's functionality by facilitating the integration of new protocols and interfaces. At its core, a Step Driver comprises three essential components:

1. **OpenAPI Specification Design**: The foundation of every Step Driver lies in crafting a machine-readable OpenAPI specification. This specification serves as a blueprint, outlining the structure and behavior of the custom test steps to be integrated into Cycle.

2. **HTTP Server Implementation**: The Step Driver hosts an HTTP server, exposing the defined OpenAPI specification. This server acts as the conduit through which Cycle communicates with the external system under test.

3. **API Handlers Implementation**: These handlers represent the heart of the Step Driver, responsible for interpreting the requests from Cycle and orchestrating the corresponding actions on the targeted system. By implementing these handlers, developers encapsulate the logic necessary to interact with the SUT effectively.

### Empowering Partnerships

One of the most compelling aspects of Step Drivers is their ability to foster collaboration and innovation within the testing community. By offering a standardized framework for extending Cycle's capabilities, we empower partners to create custom Step Drivers tailored to their unique testing requirements.

### What to Expect

In this tutorial series, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of creating your own Step Driver, from designing the OpenAPI specification to implementing the requisite API handlers. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a testing enthusiast eager to expand Cycle's horizons, this tutorial will equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to unlock the full potential of our platform.

### Conclusion

With Step Drivers, the possibilities for enhancing your testing workflows are virtually limitless. Join us on this journey as we embark on a quest to transform the way you approach test automation. Let's build, innovate, and redefine what's possible with Cycle.

Stay tuned for the first installment of our tutorial series, where we'll dive deeper into the intricacies of designing an OpenAPI specification for your Step Driver. Until then, happy testing!
